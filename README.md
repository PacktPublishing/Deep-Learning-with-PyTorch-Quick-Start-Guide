**Learn to train and deploy neural network models in Python**

## What is this book about?
PyTorch is extremely powerful and yet easy to learn. It provides advanced features, such as supporting multiprocessor, distributed, and parallel computation. This book is an excellent entry point for those wanting to explore deep learning with PyTorch to harness its power.

This book covers the following exciting features:
* Set up the deep learning environment using the PyTorch library
* Learn to build a deep learning model for image classification
* Use a convolutional neural network for transfer learning
* Understand to use PyTorch for natural language processing
* Use a recurrent neural network to classify text

## Instructions and Navigations
All of the code is organized into folders. For example, Chapter02.

The code will look like the following:
```
import numpy as np
x = np.array([[1,2,3],[4,5,6],[1,2,5]])
y = np.linalg.inv(x)
print (y)
print (np.dot(x,y))
```

**Following is what you need for this book:**
Developers and Data Scientist familiar with Machine Learning but new to deep learning, or existing practitioners of deep learning who would like to use PyTorch to train their deep learning models will find this book to be useful. Having knowledge of Python programming will be an added advantage, while previous exposure to PyTorch is not needed.

With the following software and hardware list you can run all code files present in the book (Chapter 1-6).
